Clarity Core components do not provide surrounding white space. Spacing between components is managed entirely by the `cds-layout` attribute. This ensures that the system is as composable as possible while keeping white space predictable and consistent.

The cds-layout attribute includes three layout types, vertical, horizontal, and grid (columns). Each is designed to handle particular layout senario.
