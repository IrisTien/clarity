# Typography

Clarity provides a collection of semantically named type classes to suit all your design needs. The typeface used is our geometric open source Clarity City, available in 5 weights.

## Classes

Heading and paragraph classes have been replaced with classes named according to their common usage. These include names such as Headline, Title, Body, and Caption. Usage guidelines assis t in determining which is appropriate for most common design requirements.

### How to use

Refer to templates for guidance in usage. The classes have recommended purposes and these follow a strict hierarchy based on 2 application types:
First are broad print style screens such as landing, login etc. where use of space is luxurious. The largest classes work well here providing visual anchors and making hierarchy clear.

Second are data dense information screens. These use the Title / section / subsection classes which have sufficient weight to provide an anchoring function in a close set of sizes which allow for clear hierarchy while being economical with space.
In both types the majority of information should be cast in Primary (body) and secondary sizes using weight and color as required.

Caption classes should be used for tertiary level supporting information only.

- Use Display and heading to anchor key information on open-sparse-broad screens.
- Use Title / section / subsection on date dense screens.
- Use Body and Secondary for the majority of content.
- Use Caption Lg and Sm for supporting information.

## Color

Each class has a defualt color best suited to its most common use and additional colors are available to use for fine tuning of hierachy. Components will often use these additional colors in cases such as placeholder and helper text.

## Line height

Clarity Core typography features variable line heights to assist in balancing the needs of vertical rhythm and data density. While all line heights are avaialble to all type classes, we recomend using them as follows:

- In most cases the default line height will be the correct choice. This is a compromise between the compact and expanded options and establishes good vertical rhythm and density.
- In dense screens such as dashboards, in compnents where visual focus is governed by the bounding box of a container or where several discrete type objects are near one another, the compact line height works well.
- In broad compositions such as landing or marketing pages where there is a lot of negative space and the type must stand on its own, the expanded line height works well in establishing a vertical rhythm at larger increments helping give order to the screen.

## Line length

Line length: When setting running copy, particularly in the `<body>` sizes such as 14px and 13px be conscious of character counts. Extremely long or short lines are more difficult to read. The users eye remaining on the current line, then returing to the beginning of the next line is most succesful when lines are of standard length.

**50 characters min / 75 characters max; 60-65 is ideal.**

## Copy Casting

Selecting sizes weights colors and styles in relation to the content is sometimes known as copy casting and is important when making descisions for type elements, regarding how they may best serve the desired outcome.

**Bold**

Use bold type for strong emphasis. Clarity uses bolder type (semibold) for key value pairs and form element labels

**Italics or oblique type**

Italics are used primarily to denote titles and names of particular works or objects in order to allow that title or name to stand out from the surrounding sentence. Italics may also be used for emphasis.

Emphasis: Gentle - use bold for stronger emphasis.

Titles of work: John Steinbecks The Grapes of Wrath
Foreign words: Using the correct options for foreign characters gives polish and accuracy to your work: é ñ
Names of vehicles: The Enterprise
Words as sounds (Onomatopoeia): Vroooom
Referring to a specific word: When using ostensible be sure to understand the meaning so you use it correctly.

Bold and italic are mutually exclusive - don’t use them together. Don’t overuse bold or italic, their function is to individualize small parts of your text elements and using them too much dilutes this purpose - if everything has emphasis, nothing does.

**ALL CAPS** should be used very rarely. They are difficult to parse, not preferred for accessibility, and may create confusing hierarchy when used too frequently. ALL CAPS are good for Logos / brands, headlines. Bold is the preferred method for creating emphasis.

Use all caps for acronyms. Other cases are not recommended. Best typography practice specifies the only other usage is for titles such as in advertisements (brand names), and print style graphics.

**Sizes and weight**

Key/Value pairs use pair classes with the heavier weight for the key and the lighter for the content (value).
When a stronger relationship for key value pairs is needed use regular / medium of the same size and color - over affording type relationship hierarchy (especially by using different sizes) is not a good practice.

Do not differentiate pairs e.g. Key/Value by using different sizes. Clarity recommends using lighter colors for the key / darker for the value. When greater differentiation is needed use weight.

**Mixed case**

Title case - sense of formality, gravitas, good for important messages - distinction between modern and traditional types. More sophisticated / more error prone.
Sentence case - most friendly, best for any extended passage of text i.e. body copy. Easiest to use / fewest errors / greatest consistency.

Clarity recommends to use sentence case for consistency unless case specific formatting requires otherwise. Title case _would_ be preferred for titles (anything using the largest 3 classes: display, heading, title) but this should be considered with caution as errors are more likley. Should you wish to use title case: Use it for TITLES - if a text object is a complete sentence it is less likely to be a title and less likely to be an appropriate use of title case. Title case follows the pattern of capitalizing all important words - what is an important word? Any word that carries content - nouns verbs adjectives, not words which assist or connect such as articles, prepositions, conjunctions.

**Title case examples:**

The Amazing Dogs of the Northern Provinces
Overview Screen for the Virtual Network
The Rose in His Heart

**Sentence case examples:**
The amazing dogs of the northern provincesin action.
Overview screen for the virtual network in pictures.
The lover tells of the rose in his heart.
